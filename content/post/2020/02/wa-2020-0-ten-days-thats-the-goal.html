<p>My English ability is declining - This is the feeling I have often these days. Although I've been accepting the fact that my English fluency is not getting better, having <em>decline</em> is different. I have struggled to articulate my <em>engineering</em> points to my teammates, which feels like a real threat.</p><p>More practice is needed, probably speaking, but writing is easier. So I decided to start some writing practice: I'll write some random trivial stuff once a day for ten days. I expect it to be plain diary and do not expect it to be worth a read. That aims to be pure practice.</p><p>What should I write about today, then? Here you go...</p><p><hr></p><p>Why is my English fluency declining? There are several contributing factors.</p><p>First of all, I have spent no time <span style="text-decoration:underline;">on</span> explicit English practice. I simply cannot afford <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;">it</span></span>. This isn't great, but it's just a plain fact.</p><p>Secondly, I've largely withdrawn from podcast listening for a month. I still listen time to time, but my phone no longer has any podcast app installed. The intention was to spend more time on long-form audio books and my own thinking, and it paid off. However, thinking more to me means thinking in Japanese, and also listening <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to</span> written English like Audiobook<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span> isn't like listening <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to</span> people speaking and somehow doesn't have the language gravity podcasts had. It might <del>be</del> matter of taking back podcast<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span> again to my life, but somehow doesn't feel like that today.</p><p>Relatedly, I feel myself in a kind of introspective mode these days. I like to be introspective, but it's not <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span> great way to be aware of languages. What's worse, my introspection is solely done in Japanese.</p><p>Probably I should spend more time on consuming spoken media, talking to people and thinking in English. I don't feel like that, but there needs <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to be</span> some balance to hit. This writing project is a not-so-promising attempt to hit the balance.</p><p><hr></p><p>By the way, have you tried Google Docs' spell checker recently? It's <em>amazing</em>. I wrote the text above in a single path, and pasted it to a gdoc, and edited based on the suggestion. I underscored such edits. I guess I could've spotted some of them if I re-read, but all of t hem. It's worth highlighting - It tells me my misspelling patterns.</p><p>Anyway, spell checker. It's worth a shot. (I guess GMail is now using the same checker, but I'm not sure.)</p><p>Edit: I've made several edits after the spell checker applied. There are endless mistakes and rough edges.</p>
