<p>These days I feel like <del>that</del> my procrastination is killing me. My chores are stacking up, my work is disorganized, but I cannot take any action and just keep wandering the internet news sites. My instinct is pushing back against the home obligation. At the same time, it feels guilty to spend time to think<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span> about work without fulfilling the home responsibility. I'm almost paralyzed by this conflict, and it's called procrastination.</p><p>Is it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span> matter of productivity and I should revisit things like GTD? Maybe. Maybe not. I'm depressed? Slightly, if any. Is this a midlife crisis? I don't know. I think I need some soul searching to convince myself.</p>
