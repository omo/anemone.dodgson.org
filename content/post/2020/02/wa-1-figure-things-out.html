<p>A teammate came back from his business trip to a remote office in Asia. I found that I've missed him.</p><p>Let's call him T.Â  T is the one I talk the most at work, and he's the one who has interesting topics. My work days were quiet while he was traveling. And that's over.</p><p>T traveled to talk to the people below the tech stack. I and T have been talking about adding some corner-cutting private API across the stack for performance optimizations, but we knew too little about the lower layer to make it happen. So the goal <span style="text-decoration:underline;">of</span> his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">trip</span> was to figure the plan out with the team who know the needed details.</p><p>T went there because this is his project. At the same time, he went there <span style="text-decoration:underline;">on my behalf</span> because it's also my project. Precisely speaking, it is still not a proper project with substantial commitment, but we want <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to</span> make it real. T took action for that while I didn't.</p><p>T figured it out, but he probably wouldn't make it, that is, he probably wouldn't write any code for that. That's likely to be my part.</p><p>That's because ... T is a manager, specifically a TL-M. A tricky part is that he's not <em>my</em> manager. He did the legwork not because his reportees needed it but because he thought it was important for hitting bigger goal<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>, for which I'm also responsible.</p><p>I feel bad for him - Probably I should've traveled instead of him, or at least we should've gone together. Or he should be able to work on the whole project by himself. The talk-code separation invites bureaucracy. I hate it, but I realized I just did call it.</p><p>I've been frustrated by my lack of <del>the</del> action, but I'm almost giving it up. Why do I have to depend on him? Why does he have to depend on me? Why cannot we pursue these technical challenges from the beginning to the end by each of ourselves?</p><p>This question can be easily answered in a way that critics do. But I would reject that. It's just a noise unless being actionable. I'll figure it out. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Meanwhile</span>, T has a bumper-sticker message in the intranet profile page. It says: Figure Things Out.</p>
