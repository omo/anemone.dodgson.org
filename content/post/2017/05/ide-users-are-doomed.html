<p>また<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14403036">ゴミスレ</a>を読んでしまった・・・</p><p><blockquote>I met my wife because she was stuck in VI. I was a unix sysadmin in the early 90s, and she was a grad student. She came to me for help (like most of the 1st years did) because she couldn't get out of vi.</blockquote></p><p>そして</p><p><blockquote>And I met mine, while she needed help trying to copy paste in emacs.
IDE users, you're doomed to stay single!</blockquote></p><p>さらに</p><p><blockquote>I wooed my wife by being able to solve a computer problem as well. Her laptop wouldn't boot, and she had a paper on the hard drive that needed to be submitted that day. "I have just the thing," I said, and I ran home to get my drive-to-USB adapter. Pulled her hard drive, recovered the paper, and printed it from my own laptop. The rest is history.</blockquote></p><p>映像的には最後のが汗臭くていいな。</p>
