<p>I ended up making eight posts last month, which is a lot fewer than other months.</p><p>This small project proved my lack of writing ability in the language. It takes longer, it is harder to articulate ideas, and the hardest part is that, it is so burdensome that I virtually cannot think while writing: The idea has to be clarified enough before being written down. It hampers the purpose of writing, as I write to think.</p><p>I'll keep this project as a kind of exercise for a while, probably by doing bi-monthly: In coming odd months I'll write with the accent.</p>
