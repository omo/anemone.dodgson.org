<p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/time-refresh-introducing-new-look-and-features-google-calendar-web/">Google Calendar recently got new look</a>. It tells me the shortcut I wasn't aware: Mode switch using A/D/W/M/Y/X keys. The UI gives indicators to tell the shortcuts.Â The cumbersomeness of mode switch had frustrated me for a long time, but not anymore!</p><p>I'm on the cynical side on Material-ization and/or mobilization the desktop Web UI, and I don't think Google Calendar isn't particularly loved product, but this change is decent and I do like the product a bit more than before now.</p>
