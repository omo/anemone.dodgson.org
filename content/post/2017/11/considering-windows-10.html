<p>My life with Linux laptop has passed more than two years now but I still miss some apps like Evernote or DayOne on Mac. Buyng a MBP comes to my mind time to time, but the <a href="https://marco.org/2017/11/14/best-laptop-ever">mixed reviews of the latest Macbook like this</a> keeps me away. I've never heard reasonable applause for Touchbar either, which replaced much needed (for Intelli-J users including myself) function keys. And yes, it is expensive.</p><p>Another idea popped up here - Why not Windows? The Linux laptop I have (XPS13) is capable to run Windows. Windows has more apps than Linux (it's even silly to mention.) The barriers here are the unfriendliness against Unix-style computing and the stigma it carries.</p><p>However... Does it really matter? Can you just grab a cloud node if you need some Linux? Or why not just own a small always-on instance?</p><p>It matters when you run some ML stuff like TensorFlow: It needs a lot of memory and CPU cycle and it's nice to have fast local CPUs and a few GB of memory because buying comparable VM is still expensive. On the other hand, it's not clear if I do such kind of work in coming months.</p><p>Stepping back, I see there is a fear. Fear that if I walk away from Linux, I might no longer code because of the friction. In other words, By choosing Linux laptop I pay the friction for anything other than programming. The question would be that if it's a fair price. I'm not sure.</p><p>Probably I should give it a try,Â  for overcoming that fear.</p>
