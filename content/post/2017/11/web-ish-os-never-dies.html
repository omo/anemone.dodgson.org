<p>A friend of mine pointed out that a popular feature phone in India called <a href="https://www.jio.com/en-in/book-jio-phone">Jio Phone</a>Â is powered by a Web-based OS. The OS is called <a href="http://www.kaiostech.com/">Kai OS</a> and, it turned out, is a fork of Firefox OS.</p><p>These phones will be taken over by richer, touch-based smart phones eventually, but it's still heartwarming to see a Web-based OS striving.</p>
