<p>Here is the list:</p><p><ul>
    <li>Any Macbook Pros - Too expensive, lack of NVIDIA GPU, Fear of the Touchbar.</li>
    <li>Lightroom CC - No supported platform available at home. No time to play either.</li>
    <li>Windows 10 - Too far away from my terminal-centric world.</li>
    <li>A DSLR or Lenses - Without Lightroom CC it'd be pointless.</li>
    <li>Nintendo Switch - No time to play.</li>
    <li>Kindle Oasis - Not in the Kindle ecosystem.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CYXTAGK/">A Baby Mattress</a> - Planning to switch the crib in a few months.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E07D76S/">An Oven Toaster</a> - Not useful-looking enough to justify the space it'll occupy.</li>
</ul></p><p>Does this mean I'm a smart buyer with great willpower? No way. I just buy what I want without waiting these huge sale seasons. (And buying stuff just because it's cheap feels silly to me, but I don't argue.)</p><p>Regardless, pondering Â about spending money is stressing and fun at the same time. That's what shopping is all about.</p>
